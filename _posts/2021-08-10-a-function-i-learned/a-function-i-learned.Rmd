```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, include = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

`ggplot()` is a function that makes different kinds of plots. This example uses data from the palmerpenguins dataset and shows body mass vs flipper length. The graph shown below is a scatterplot, defined by `geom_point()`. The graph also is colored by species, using `geom_point(aes(color = species))`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
  labs(title = "Body Mass vs Flipper Length", 
       x = " Flipper Length (mm)", 
       y = "Body Mass (g)")
```
