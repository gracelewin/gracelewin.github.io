I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology from the University of California, Davis. While pursuing my degree and after graduation, I have had multiple experiences that have reinforced this passion.\n            While studying abroad along the Garden Route in South Africa, I was intrigued by the diverse ecosystems and unique conservation challenges of the region. I then came back to UC Davis to conduct an undergraduate independent research project studying seed dispersal in a California serpentine environment. I then went on to pursue additional research opportunities as a field technician in the Young Lab at UCSB where I studied the impact of wildlife loss and human change on community dynamics and ecological processes.\n            I see the importance and necessity in working across disciplines to adequately answer complex ecological questions. This was highlighted during my time working at the Mpala Research Center in Kenya as an NSF REU intern. There, building upon knowledge gained from ecology, engineering, and computer science, I worked with a team of graduate students and professors to build and implement novel, low-cost, autonomous remote sensing devices to measure the carbon flux of the savanna grassland ecosystem. This interdisciplinary experience has led me to pursue a Master of Environmental Data Science degree at the Bren School. I am excited to utilize data science skills to integrate interdisciplinary data to discover new insights and solutions to environmental problems.\n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Grace Lewin\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              About Me….\n              I have a passion for understanding and conserving the natural world.
