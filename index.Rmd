<!-- I am a current Masters of Environmental Data Science student at the Bren school.  -->


<!-- The Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara -->

<!-- I am currently a candidate for a Master of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. -->

<!-- I graduated from UC Davis with a Bachelor of Science degree in Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology.  -->

<!-- I have experience conducting field work in various grassland ecosystems from Kenya to California. …say more about what research focused on… -->

<!-- Enjoy outdoor activities, camping, biking, hiking, rafting… -->

<!-- Studied abroad in South Africa which introduced me to wildlife conservation initiatives, community involvement initiatives, and …  -->

<!-- To purse my interest in… understand more of the diverse African ecosystems… where I worked on flux bots… this introduced me to the field of remote sensing and the vast potential it has for understanding and collecting environmental data. -->

<!-- Studied abroad … led to … and interests in … -->



<!-- I am excited to learn data science skills to integrate data from multiple fields to more fully understand environmental issues and to work towards solutions for them.  -->


<!-- Field work -->
<!-- Grasslands -->
<!-- Engineering -->
<!-- Remote sensing -->
<!-- Outdoors (rafting) -->
<!-- Research -->


<!-- I combined my physics and ecology backgrounds to build and implement in the field low cost, innovative remote sensing devices to measure the carbon flux of a Kenyan savanna grassland. – introduced me to remote sensing -->

<!-- Seed research – introduced me to data analysis -->
