Grace Lewin graduated from the University of California, Davis, with a Bachelor of Science in Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology. She began her undergraduate education by pursuing a physics degree for two years, but ultimately decided to complete her degree in conservation to follow her passion for conserving and better understanding the natural world after studying abroad in South Africa. There, she learned about the diverse South African biomes, their unique conservation challenges, and resulting innovative conservation and community involvement initiatives. To further understand another unique African ecosystem, she then worked at the Mpala Research Center in Kenya as an NSF REU intern to build and implement low cost, novel, autonomous remote sensing devices to measure the carbon flux of the Kenyan savanna grassland ecosystem. This gave her the opportunity to work at the intersection of ecology, engineering, and computer science, and was a valuable introduction to the field of remote sensing. She then continued research of grassland ecosystems closer to home by completing an independent research project on seed dispersal in a California serpentine environment where she developed essential fieldwork, data collection, and data analysis skills. Most recently, she has worked as a field technician for Dr. Hillary Youngâ€™s lab at UCSB collecting data for community ecology experiments focused on the effects of anthropogenic change on herbivore loss and wildfire. Now as a MEDS Bren student, she is excited to utilize data science skills to integrate interdisciplinary data to discover new insights and solutions for environmental problems.
